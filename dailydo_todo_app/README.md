## Overview
`main.py` serves as the core of the FastAPI application, handling API routes, database integration, and application configuration. This file initializes the FastAPI app, sets up database sessions, and defines dependency injection.

## Key Components
1. **FastAPI Application**
   - The FastAPI instance is created and serves as the entry point for handling requests.

2. **Database Integration**
   - Uses SQLModel and a PostgreSQL database.
   - Establishes the database engine.
   - Provides session management via dependency injection.

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - `get_session`: Ensures that each request has a fresh database session.

4. **API Routes**
   - Various endpoints for handling CRUD operations on todos.

## How It Works
1. FastAPI initializes the application.
2. The database session is injected into route handlers.
3. Requests interact with the database via SQLModel.
4. Once the request completes, the session closes.

## Running `main.py`
Run the FastAPI application using:
```sh
uvicorn dailydo_todo_app.main:app --reload
```
